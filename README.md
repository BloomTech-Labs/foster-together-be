## Project Overview

- [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HhPz69no/foster-together)
- [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Foster-Together-f7ff4ab169724a83a9eec6500829ec18)
- [UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/NRkSfUIkcMXwxkVVNtH97P/Foster-Together-Marc-%26-Frantz?node-id=582%3A95597)

Foster Together is a nonprofit organization that connects foster families to volunteers (or "neighbors") in their area that can help with various tasks like cooking and transportation.

The main problem that the organization faces: data is scattered into multiple emails and spreadsheets, making it difficult to keep track of neighbors and foster family information.

Our goal with this application is to streamline the process for volunteer and family sign up, make it easier for the admins to view and interact with data, and automate the matching process.

From the [Foster Together](https://www.fostertogether.co/) website:

> In general, two myths persist about foster parents. Either they're "doing it for the money" (sometimes true, but not the norm) or they're a special, heroic kind of person with time and a big heart to spare. Through a public relations campaign based on real life foster parents, Foster Together will introduce you to "someone like you" who makes foster care work, with the right motivations and support from neighbors.

> When tragedy strikes, local communities jump in with tangible relief efforts. Foster care exists as disaster relief in the most tragic of life events for a child. Through Random Acts of Foster Kindness, we connect neighbors with foster parents to meet a simple need like a delicious feast delivered at dinnertime, or transportation for a child's therapy appointments. We make it easy. We make it fast. We make it relational.

### Key Features

- Registration process for families and neighbors
- Dashboard for admins to view and interact with database
- Integration with Sterling for background checks

## Tech Stack

### Back end built using:

#### [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

#### [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

#### [Knex](http://knexjs.org/)

Knex.js is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use. It features both traditional node style callbacks as well as a promise interface for cleaner async flow control, a stream interface, full featured query and schema builders, transaction support (with savepoints), connection pooling and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.

#### [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

# APIs

#### [SendGrid](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)

Sends email to member upon application approval, ready to be configured to send emails in other situations as well. Should set up a route for the admins to upload emails in serialised format and then send those emails for each situation. EX. PUT /emails/app/approved. 

#### [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/javascript/) (coming soon)

Contentful will be used to make the training and possibly the application data easily changeable by the administators (non tech) users of the site. It will greatly reduce the amount of hardcoded and repeated data in the front end of the site as well. 

#### [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-card-without-authentication/) (coming soon)

Stripe will be used to collect the payment for the background check. Flat rate of 20 dollars. Account has been set up already and API keys are available from it upon login. Link to the documentation for the integration that was previously working, but there is also Stripe Checkout that could be used. 

#### [Checkr](https://docs.checkr.com/) (coming soon)

Checkr will be used to perform the background check. Create a Canidate profile upon completion of the Stripe payment using the user's email, then use the invitation API to send that user an invitation to complete the background check on Checkr. Will also need a POST route to collect the data from the Checkr WebHooks so we can update the database with the results when they're available. Account has been set up already and API keys are available upon login. 

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

All enviroment variables ending in test are set up differently than a typical postgres URL to account for AWS RDS. 
This allows CI on AWS to use RDS databases to test on, keeping production exactly the same as staging and testing. 

* PORT - Port you would like to run sever on.
* NODE_ENV - set to "development" 
* DATABASE_URL - development DB url (postgres)
* HOSTNAME_TEST - postgres hostname
* USERNAME_TEST - postgres username
* PASSWORD_TEST - postgres paswword
* PORT_TEST - postgres port
* NAME_TEST - database
* JWT_SECRET - string for jwt secret
* SENDGRID_API_KEY - key for SENDGRID API.


# Testing

- Jest
- Supertest

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- Create local PostgreSQL database for development
- Create local or AWS RDS database for testing
- `npm i` to install all required dependencies
- Set your enviroment variables. (details below)
- `npm start` to start the local server
- `npm test` to run all tests in the testing environment

## Actions

`add(data)` -> Insert a foster neighbor, family, or admin account

`find()` -> Get a list of all foster neighbors or families

`find(filter)` -> Get foster neighbor(s) or famili(es) by a key name, ie `{ email }`

`update(id, data)` -> Update a foster neighbor or family's contact information, or an admin's account info

`remove(id)` -> Delete a foster neighbor or family

#### NOTE
There is an application table with various questions in indivdual tables, but per engineering manager, should be changed to a single serialised table. Working as written, but would be much simplier serialised.
